Session 2 homework

Two takeaways from Mod 0:
  -Organization and time management are keys to my success. In order to be successful, I must be super organized and know when everything is due. Time management is also really important to maintain schoolwork, projects, personal time, etc.

  -Learning how to google is ok. So is not understanding something. There will be plenty of times where I do not understand something, but how i move on from the not understanding is what will help me the most.

Two strategies I will add over the next two weeks:
  -I will preview and review each section of material before and after each session. It will help me learn and will create good habits for Mod 1.
  -Sticking to a calendar I create. Getting on top of my time management skills now seem like the most important thing I can do to be successful.
