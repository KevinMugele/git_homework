Session 2 homework

Two takeaways from Mod 0:
  -Organization and time management are keys to my success. In order to be successful, I must be super organized and know when everything is due. Time management is also really important to maintain schoolwork, projects, personal time, etc.

  -Learning how to google is ok. So is not understanding something. There will be plenty of times where I do not understand something, but how i move on from the not understanding is what will help me the most.
