Session 2 homework

Two takeaways from Mod 0:
  -Organization and time management are keys to my success. In order to be successful, I must be super organized and know when everything is due. Time management is also really important to maintain schoolwork, projects, personal time, etc.

  -Learning how to google is ok. So is not understanding something. There will be plenty of times where I do not understand something, but how i move on from the not understanding is what will help me the most.

Two strategies I will add over the next two weeks:

  -I will preview and review each section of material before and after each session. It will help me learn and will create good habits for Mod 1.

  -Sticking to a calendar I create. Getting on top of my time management skills now seem like the most important thing I can do to be successful.

One shoutout from the last two weeks:

  -I was in a breakout room with Erika. After we successfully completed the work, we ran out of time. She messaged me on Slack and said we did a great job. I thought it was very encouraging and look forward to collaborating with my classmates more.

  -Special shoutout to my best friend Michael. He graduated Turing in 2017 and has helped me, encouraged me, and motivated me to be here.

Some additions during Session 3:

  -Everyone is really nice.

  -I made and linked my first repository.
